## Chapter 1: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### 1.1 Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods to manipulate that data. The key principles of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class).
- **Abstraction:** Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
- **Inheritance:** Mechanism by which one class can inherit attributes and methods from another class.
- **Polymorphism:** Ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.

### 1.2 Classes and Objects

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class. Classes define the attributes and behaviors of an object.

#### Defining a Class

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says woof!")

# Create an object
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.age)   # Output: 3
my_dog.bark()       # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

### 1.3 Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement abstract method")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says meow!"

# Create objects
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
print(cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers says meow!
```

### 1.4 Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

```python
class Bird:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says tweet!"

animals = [Dog("Buddy"), Cat("Whiskers"), Bird("Tweety")]

for animal in animals:
    print(animal.speak())
```

### 1.5 Encapsulation

Encapsulation restricts direct access to an object's data and methods. This can be achieved using private (__) and protected (_) attributes.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.__make = make
        self.__model = model
        self.__year = year

    def get_info(self):
        return f"{self.__year} {self.__make} {self.__model}"

    def set_year(self, year):
        self.__year = year

# Create an object
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2010)
print(my_car.get_info())  # Output: 2010 Toyota Corolla
my_car.set_year(2020)
print(my_car.get_info())  # Output: 2020 Toyota Corolla
```

### 1.6 Abstraction

Abstraction hides the complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features of an object. It can be achieved using abstract classes and methods.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

# Create an object
rect = Rectangle(4, 5)
print(f"Area of rectangle: {rect.area()}")  # Output: Area of rectangle: 20
```

### 1.7 Example: Bank Account

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount
        return self.__balance

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.__balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds!")
        self.__balance -= amount
        return self.__balance

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

def main():
    account = BankAccount("Alice", 1000)

    while True:
        print("\n1. Deposit")
        print("2. Withdraw")
        print("3. Check Balance")
        print("4. Exit")
        choice = int(input("Enter choice: "))

        try:
            if choice == 1:
                amount = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: "))
                print(f"New balance: ${account.deposit(amount)}")
            elif choice == 2:
                amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))
                print(f"New balance: ${account.withdraw(amount)}")
            elif choice == 3:
                print(f"Current balance: ${account.get_balance()}")
            elif choice == 4:
                print("Goodbye!")
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid choice!")
        except ValueError as e:
            print(e)

# Start the Bank Account program
main()
```

## Chapter 2: Decorators

### 2.1 Introduction to Decorators

Decorators are a way to modify the behavior of a function or class method without changing its actual code. They are useful for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, and caching.

### 2.2 Function Decorators

A function decorator takes a function as an argument, defines a nested function (wrapper) that extends or alters the behavior of the original function, and returns the nested function.

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

### 2.3 Class Decorators

Class decorators are used to modify the behavior of classes. They work similarly to function decorators but operate on class definitions.

```python
def class_decorator(cls):
    class Wrapped(cls):
        def new_method(self):
            return "New method added"
    return Wrapped

@class_decorator
class MyClass:
    def original_method(self):
        return "Original method"

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.original_method())  # Output: Original method
print(obj.new_method())       # Output: New method added
```

### 2.4 Example: Logging Decorator

```python
def logging_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} called with arguments {args} and {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@logging_decorator
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(5, 3))  # Output: Function add called with arguments (5, 3) and {}
                  #         Function add returned 8
                  #         8
```

## Chapter 3: Generators

### 3.1 Introduction to Generators

Generators are functions that return an iterable set of items, one at a time, in a special way. They allow you to iterate through data without storing it all in memory at once, making them memory-efficient.

### 3.2 Creating Generators

A generator function uses the `yield` keyword to return values one at a time. Each call to the generator resumes where it left off.

```python
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

for value in my_generator():
    print(value)
```

### 3.3 Generator Expressions

Generator expressions provide an easier way to create generators, similar to list comprehensions but with parentheses instead of square brackets.

```python


gen_exp = (x * x for x in range(5))

for value in gen_exp:
    print(value)
```

### 3.4 Example: Fibonacci Sequence

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

for num in fibonacci(10):
    print(num)  # Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

## Chapter 4: Context Managers

### 4.1 Introduction to Context Managers

Context managers allow you to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to. The most common way to use context managers is with the `with` statement, which ensures that resources are properly released even if an error occurs.

### 4.2 Using `with` Statement

The `with` statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks.

```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
```

### 4.3 Creating Custom Context Managers

You can create custom context managers using the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods in a class.

```python
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering the context")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print("Exiting the context")

with MyContextManager():
    print("Inside the context")
```

### 4.4 Example: File Handling with Context Managers

```python
class FileManager:
    def __init__(self, filename, mode):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mode = mode

    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.filename, self.mode)
        return self.file

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.file.close()

with FileManager("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
```

## Chapter 5: Concurrency and Parallelism

### 5.1 Introduction to Concurrency and Parallelism

Concurrency and parallelism allow you to run multiple tasks simultaneously to improve performance. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once, while parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

### 5.2 Using `threading` for Concurrency

The `threading` module provides a way to create and manage threads in Python. Threads allow you to run multiple operations concurrently in the same process.

```python
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

### 5.3 Using `multiprocessing` for Parallelism

The `multiprocessing` module provides a way to create and manage processes in Python, allowing you to take advantage of multiple CPU cores. Each process runs in its own memory space.

```python
import multiprocessing

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

process = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_numbers)
process.start()
process.join()
```

### 5.4 Example: Parallel Processing

```python
import multiprocessing

def square_number(n):
    return n * n

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:
    results = pool.map(square_number, numbers)

print(results)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
